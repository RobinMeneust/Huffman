Check table syntax
SDL ?
Use larger buffers when writting in files ?
Reduce table size
Add doxygen comments for newf fcuntions

Use a tree to compress/decompress to speed up the process for big files ? IDEA:
_______________________________
0= go back
1= continue

(+one to know when to get a value?) -> or auto when '_#'

2 lines in the table file: 1st = position and 2nd = value when needed

ex:
1101001
cba

    
  	   / \
  	  /   \
	 /     \
	/	    \
	0	    1-a
   / \
  /   \
 0-c  1-b
